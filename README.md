To run these files in Linux (or Mac OS X, if you can get PyQt4 installed):

- Make sure PyQt4 and other required libraries are installed.
- For sound, make sure JACK (a.k.a. qjackctl) and the fluidsynth library are installed, and make sure you update the directory to a library of soundfonts (currently /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2). 
- Download, 
- extract to a folder, 
- type "python FAIT.py" from the terminal while in that folder. 

Currently, music requires the fluidsynth library and a set of soundfonts to be installed.
